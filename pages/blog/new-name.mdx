If you've been following our journey since the beginning, we used to be called [Screenwriter](https://screenwriter.dev). A lot has change since then, and we're excited to announce that we're rebranding to Momentic!

It's kinda insane to think that we started as an idea during [buildspace n&w s4](https://buildspace.so/s4/demoday/screenwriter), and now we're a full-fledged company with a team of two. We've been working hard to build a platform that helps developers build faster, and we're excited to share our progress with you.
